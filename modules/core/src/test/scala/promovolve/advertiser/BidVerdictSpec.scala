/**
 * The advertiser's bid checker (State.bidVerdict): "would this campaign bid
 * on a page like this?" — answered by the same predicate the auction uses,
 * applied the same way. Pinned here is the part that was live and wrong to
 * read by hand on 2026-08-23: a campaign targeting Hotels (668) did not bid
 * on a Spas (671) page even though both are Travel Type — page categories
 * fan out to their ANCESTORS, never sideways — and the checker must say
 * "category" for that, not "place" or "audience", because those passed.
