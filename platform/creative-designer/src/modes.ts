// The edit modes the designer supports: the 9:16 expanded reader
// (every device renders it — full-bleed on mobile, floating portrait
// sheet on PC) and four ASPECT BUCKETS for collapsed banners. The
// reader ("mobile") mutations target `page.banners["mobile-expanded"]`;
// bucket mutations target `page.banners[sizeKey]`.
//
// The 16:9 wide layout (storage `page.layout`) has NO TAB. Delivery
// renders the portrait master on every device (2026-07, see
// banner-component pickExpandedLayout), so 16:9 stopped being an
// authoring surface — but `page.layout` persists as a DELIVERY
// ARTIFACT: (a) 16:9-ish COLLAPSED slots render it (the implicit
// master candidate in pickCollapsedLayout), (b) creatives published
// before the portrait fanout fall back to it in the reader, and
// (c) masterColor anchors collapsed-bucket colours on it — the
// portrait master is often white-on-scrim (full-bleed image), which
// would be unreadable inherited onto flat collapsed backgrounds.
// The auto-layout fanout keeps authoring it invisibly (WIDE_MASTER
// below), and the pin/main-image flows keep its hero in sync; it's
// just not hand-editable anymore.
//
// Why buckets, not the full IAB size list: creatives are fluid —
// delivery picks the authored layout whose aspect is NEAREST the
// slot's and renders it into the slot's actual box (percent-based
// layout, no letterboxing). Per-pixel-size variants were waste: a
// 336×280 layout next to a 300×250 one was two Gemini generations and
// two author tabs for the same shape (both 1.20:1), while a 320×100
// slot got the squeezed 16:9 master because the old exact-match lookup
// ignored the almost-right strip layout.
//
// WHAT THE BUCKET SET MUST COVER: every size the WordPress plugin
// offers by name (blocks/slot/editor.js SIZES — the publisher-facing
// menu, so these are the shapes real inventory actually declares) has
// to resolve to a bucket at ZERO aspect distance. Measured on
// pickCollapsedLayout's log-aspect metric (banner-component/utils.ts):
//
//   300×250 Medium rectangle 1.200 → 300x250   exact
//   336×280 Large rectangle  1.200 → 300x250   exact — SAME 6:5 shape,
//                                    which is why it gets no tab of its
//                                    own: a second identical-aspect
//                                    bucket is one more thing to author
//                                    for zero delivery difference, and
//                                    ties in the picker are arbitrary.
//   728×90  Leaderboard      8.089 → 728x90    exact
//   970×250 Billboard        3.880 → 970x250   exact
//   320×50  Mobile banner    6.400 → 320x50    exact (was 0.234 off,
//                                    served by the 8:1 strip)
//   300×600 Half page        0.500 → 300x600   exact
//   160×600 Wide skyscraper  0.267 → 160x600   exact (was 0.629 off —
//                                    the worst hole by far: a half-page
//                                    layout stretched into a 1:3.75 box)
//
// So the bucket count follows publisher-declarable inventory, not the
// IAB catalogue; odd custom slots in between still land on whichever
// bucket is nearest.
//
// sizeKeys keep their canonical pixel names ("300x250" etc.) so
// existing creatives' authored layouts stay first-class with no
// migration; layouts stored under retired keys (336x280, 970x90)
// remain in the creative JSON and the nearest-aspect picker still
// serves them — they're just no longer editable tabs here. Creatives
// published before a bucket existed need no migration either: they
// keep resolving to their nearest authored shape.
